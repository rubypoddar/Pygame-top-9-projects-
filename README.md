## About

The 3D Solar System Simulation provides an interactive and educational experience, allowing users to explore the dynamics of our solar system. It offers a realistic representation of planetary orbits and sizes, making it a valuable tool for astronomy enthusiasts and educators alike.

## Features

- **Realistic 3D Representation**: Planets are rendered in three dimensions, providing an immersive experience.
- **Interactive Environment**: Users can navigate the solar system, adjust camera angles, and zoom in/out for detailed exploration.
- **Educational Tool**: Offers insights into celestial dynamics, planet sizes, and orbital mechanics.
- **Customization Options**: Users can tweak various parameters to simulate different scenarios and perspectives.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python (3.6+) and Pygame (2.0.1) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rubypoddar/Pygame-top-9-projects-.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Pygame-top-9-projects-/3D solar system
    ```

4. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    python solar_system.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Upon running the simulation, you'll be immersed in a 3D representation of the solar system.
2. Use arrow keys to rotate the camera angle, mouse scroll to zoom in/out, and spacebar to pause/resume the simulation.
3. Explore the orbits of planets and their relative positions to gain insights into celestial dynamics.
